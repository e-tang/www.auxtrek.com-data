       Before you buy a night scalper please be aware of the risks involved:
        1) Past performance is no guarantee of future profitability (the EA could also make losses). 
        2) The backtests shown (EG: in screenshots) are highly optimised to find the best parameters but therefore results cannot be transferred to live trading.
