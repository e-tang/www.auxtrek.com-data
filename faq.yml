  a: Auxtrek International  Ltd is a NDD broker, which means that we just clear our clients’ trades and retranslate quotes we get from our liquidity providers. Orders in the real market are always executed at current market prices, which is why a slippage may occur in the case of a sharp movement. Please note, that during market-moving news or high volatility, the risk of slippage is higher than during normal conditions. With us, you will get both positive and negative slippages.
- q: What are your margin call/stop out levels?
  a: "Our margin call / stop out levels are 100% / 50%
  Your account may be subject to a margin call if your account equity falls to a level that is equal to the margin of your existing positions. For example, you have an open position of 1 lot on EURUSD. The margin to hold that position is 200.
  When you opened the account, you had a 1000 USD equity on your account. When the position starts to move against you and your account equity falls to 200 USD, you will have a margin call. But your position will not be closed yet. When your account equity falls to 50% of the required margin, then the system starts to close your positions immediately.
  Taking the above example, if you open a position with 200 USD of margin and your account equity falls to 60 USD, then the system starts to close your position. If you have several positions opened, then the system closes them starting from the one with the biggest loss.
  If, while closing the positions, your account equity reaches a level of more than 50% of the required margin, all other positions will remain open."
